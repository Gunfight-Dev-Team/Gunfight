# Gunfight
A Multi-player Top-Down 2D shooter game

## About The Project
### Introduction
Gunfight is a Top Down 2D shooter where two teams fight each other to advance in a tournament-style game. Each player spawns with the same weapon and whichever team is last standing wins that round. Games go on for a best of 5 rounds to see who advances. There is also a free-for-all game mode where random weapons spawn around the map and you have to right to survive.

### Related Work
We really took inspiration from three games and combined them into one.
- Impact Point: We liked the way this game did top-down weapons and shooting
- Hotline Miami: We liked the way this game was fast-paced and intense
- Call of Duty (game mode): We liked the 2v2 tournament game mode in this game

Our game is different because the gunfight tournament gameplay has never been done in 2D before. Basically, the only thing we are taking from the impact point is the movement and gunplay. Also, our art style is more cohesive and uses a *70â€™s vector* art style.

## Design
The gameplay experience is trying to convey the intense and gritty nature of a life of competing for resources. It is meant to immerse the player in a world of conflict and danger, where every decision could mean the difference between life and death. The fast-paced and intense gameplay is meant to convey the urgency of the situation and the need to act quickly and decisively.

### Controls
In this game, the player has a variety of inputs available to them in order to navigate and interact with the game world. The primary means of movement is through the use of the **WASD** keys, which allow the player to move their character forward, backward, left, and right. This movement is crucial for exploring the game's world, dodging enemy attacks, and positioning oneself for strategic advantage. 
In addition to movement, the player also has the ability to use the mouse to **aim** and **fire** their weapon. The mouse allows for precise aiming, and the player can use it to **rotate** their character in any direction they choose. This is especially important during combat, where the player must be able to react quickly to enemy movements and accurately target their attacks. Furthermore, the player can use a variety of other inputs to interact with the game world. For example, they may need to **right-click** to access weapons or equipment.

### Game Feel
One of the main technical challenges in game development is creating a sense of "game feel." This refers to the tactile and responsive nature of the game's mechanics, which can greatly affect the player's experience. By optimizing collision, transforms, animation, and post-processing rendering, we can create a game that feels **responsive**, **immersive**, and **satisfying** to play.
